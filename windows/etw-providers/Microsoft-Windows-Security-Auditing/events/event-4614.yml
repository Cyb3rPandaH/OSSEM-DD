title: 'Event ID 4614: A notification package has been loaded by the Security Account
  Manager.'
description: 'This event generates every time a Notification Package has been loaded
  by the Security Account Manager.

  In reality, starting with Windows Vista, a notification package should be interpreted
  as afs Password Filter.

  Password Filters are DLLs that are loaded or called when passwords are set or changed.

  Each time a system starts, it loads the notification package DLLs from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification
  Packages registry value and performs the initialization sequence for every package.'
