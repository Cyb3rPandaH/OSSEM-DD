title: 'Event ID 4622: A security package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority.'
description: 'This event generates every time Security Package has been loaded by
  the Local Security Authority (LSA).

  Security Package is the software implementation of a security protocol (Kerberos,
  NTLM, for example). Security packages are contained in security support provider
  DLLs or security support provider/authentication package DLLs.

  Each time the system starts, the LSA loads the Security Package DLLs from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security
  Packages registry value and performs the initialization sequence for every package
  located in these DLLs.

  It is also possible to add security package dynamically using AddSecurityPackage
  function, not only during system startup process.'
