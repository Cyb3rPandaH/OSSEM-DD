title: 'Event ID 4730: A security-enabled global group was deleted'
description: 'Event 4730 is the same as 4734, but it is generated for a global security
  group instead of a local security group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations
  are the same. The type of group is the only difference.

  Event 4730(S) generates only for domain groups, so the Local sections in event 4734
  do not apply.'
