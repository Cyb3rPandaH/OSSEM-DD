title: 'Event ID 4755: A security-enabled universal group was changed'
description: 'Event 4737 is the same as 4735, but it is generated for a universal
  security group instead of a local security group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations
  are the same. The type of group is the only difference.

  Event 4755(S) generates only for domain groups, so the Local sections in event 4735
  do not apply.'
