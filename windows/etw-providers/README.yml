title: Event Tracing for Windows Logs
description: 'The Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) infrastructure provides the foundation
  for Windows Performance Toolkit. These tools provide a set of programs that hide
  the complexity of working directly with the ETW application programming interfaces
  (APIs).

  ETW enables the consistent, straightforward capture of kernel and application events.
  You can enable or disable event capture at any time without restarting the system
  or process. Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) presents the information that ETW
  collects in an easy-to-understand set of graphs and tables.

  You can capture and present selected events to non-invasively identify and diagnose
  system and application performance issues. You can enable or disable event tracing
  dynamically. Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) uses ETW to gather and organize
  critical system information. WPR acts as the session controller, starting and stopping
  the session and selecting which ETW events to record.

  WPA consumes the event trace log (ETL) file that all event providers produce in
  an ETW session. Kernel and application events can provide extensive details about
  the operation of the system. Almost every kernel event that affects overall system
  performance is defined and available to WPA.'
