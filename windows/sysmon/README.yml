title: Sysmon Event Logs
description: System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device 
  driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system 
  reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It 
  provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, 
  and changes to file creation time. By collecting the events it generates 
  using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents and subsequently analyzing 
  them, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how 
  intruders and malware operate on your network.
