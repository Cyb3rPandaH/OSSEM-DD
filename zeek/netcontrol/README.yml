title: Zeek Network Control Event Logs
description: Zeek can connect with network devices like, for example, switches 
  or soft- and hardware firewalls using the NetControl framework. The 
  NetControl framework provides a flexible, unified interface for active 
  response and hides the complexity of heterogeneous network equipment behind 
  a simple task-oriented API, which is easily usable via Zeek scripts.
